 * \brief An edge centric data structure used to represent a triangle mesh.
 * \details A half-edge mesh is comprised of directional half-edges that refer to the next edge in the triangle in
 *          counter-clockwise order. Each half-edge also provides pointers to the vertex at the head of the edge, its
 *          associated triangle face, and its flip edge which represents the same edge in the opposite direction. Using
 *          just these four pointers, one can effectively traverse and modify edges in a triangle mesh.
